# odin-landing-page
The Odin Project (TOP) landing page project.

The landing page project is at the end of the Flexbox module. Up to this point, only CSS and HTML has been introduced and this project aims to put the introductory HTML and CSS skills I've learned to this point.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The project goal is to get your design as close to the design provided by TOP in 'odin-project.png'. The general content styling info is provided in 'colors_and_stuff.png'. We're instructed not to worry about getting things pixel-perfect. The point is to create something from scratch and get various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.</p>

<p>The instructions indicate that we're free to substitute our own content. I will not be doing so as I want to move on to the next module which introduces JavaScript and think that substituting my content will slow down my progress. There will be plenty of time for me to build things with my own content down the road.</p>

<h2>Thinking and Progress</h2>
<p>This section contains notes on my thinking as I tackle the project. It will be edited as I work through the project.</p>

<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
<p>The webpage design looks have four main sections with a header at the top and a footer at the bottom. The content on the entire webpage is kept to a maximum width while the background colors in each section extends full width.</p>

</p>Start by creating the main sections: header, splash, info, quote, action, and footer. Add styles to the body and start filling out each section (top to bottom) with content based on the design.</p>


</p><strong>General TODOs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep content to max width - Done</li>
<li>Keep image placeholder fixed width- Done</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>The process went smoothly. I was able to accomplish the goal of getting a design close to what was laid out by TOP. I didn't see a live solution from TOP so I'm curious as to know how their page behaves when the browser window is adjusted to a very small width. I took a look at the live previews of some student solutions to get a sense of what others were doing and tried to apply what I think made the most sense in my solution.</p>

<p>I did not spend any time on reviewing others' code. I know I have a long way to go, and I'm sure that with practice my CSS layouts will get better. I commented my code and it should be easy to follow for those that are reviewing it. As much as I would like to optimize, I'm excited to jump into JavaScript. Let's go!</p>
